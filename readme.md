# Hand and Foot Card Game
This application is built with JavaScript. It is a work in progress. Game rules are included in the package. The card and deck classes are fleshed out. Deck generation, hand generation, and foot generation are implemented.
## Next Steps
* Will start with addressing how to end turns.
    * For the time being, will have the "other players" draw their cards, discard a card, then end turn. This will test round incrementing, multiple player actions, and allow me to continue with logic programming.
* Want to make sure "board state" will update correctly.
* Would like to work on selecting drawing from deck or discard, and the logic to break round threshold.
* Start on html and css
### Stretch Goals
* Creation of additional classes to disperse the variables and classes appropriately
* Implement a back-end to allow account creation and past performance tracking.
* Get the multiplayer fully up and running.
